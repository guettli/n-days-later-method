# n-days-later-method

This is a management method which is roughly based on [43Folders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tickler_file) and 
[Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done).

You should focus one thing at once.... but not too long.

Goal: (Zero Inbox)[https://youtu.be/z9UjeTMb3Yk]

Up to now I know only one software which supports it ([modwork](https://www.tbz-pariv.de/produkte/modwork)).

GoogleMail has a "snooze" feature, but n-days-later is a bit more.

I use the term "issue". This could be an issue in a digital issue tracking system, an email or a piece of paper if you prefere this.

I use the term "inbox" to refer to all issues which are waiting for you to get read or done.

# Step1: Take the first issue of your inbox

Take the first issue of your inbox. Avoid looking at the list of all issues in your inbox. This issue should be the newest issue (the one that arrived just some minute ago).

# Step2: Act

Case1: If you can handle this issue in less than five minutes, then do it now. Mark the issue as "done". It should be possible to do this without moving the fingers from keyboard to the mouse. The keyboard shortcut should be easy since you will use it often. Goto Step1.

Case2: You need more information to handle this issue? Ask for more info. This reply should be a connected to your issue somehow. Here is an image of an issue thread in the mail user agent thunderbird. Don't forget to alter the subject if the content changes.

You replied and asked for infos. What now? We are all just humans. It is likely that your question will get lost because the other person is very bussy. This means we need a way to resubmit the current issue n days later. It depends on the context how long. Maybe +3. This means: put this issue to hold and the system should resubmit this issue three days later. If today is monday, then on thursday should be automaticaly back in your inbox. Details for the +N spec are below. Now goto Step1

Case3: This is unimportant information? Delete it. Is there a way to avoid this in the future? (For example: unsubscribe from a useless newsletter). Again: It should be possible to do this without moving the fingers from keyboard to the mouse. Goto Step1.

Case4: A telephone call is needed. Write some notes of this conversation into the issue.

TODO: What is missing in thinderbird.... (not per mail, +N, ....)


Avoid chats, since they create too many new items. A phone call might be better then writing a lot of small messages to the same person about the same topic.
